# Inspire Me Journal

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

![logo with heart, lightbub and writing pen](assets/images/inspireme-logo.png)
I created a simple logo in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and converted it to a Favicon using [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

HTML CSS & JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Gitpod
Github
Miro
W3 HTML and CSS Validators
JSHint JavaScript Validator


(Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.)

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages - [Inspire Me Journal](https://ljtalks.github.io/journaling-app/).

To Deploy the site using GitHub Pages:

Login (or signup) to Github.
Go to the repository for this project, ljtalks/journaling-app/.
Click the settings button.
Select pages in the left hand navigation menu.
From the source dropdown select main branch and press save.
The site has now been deployed, please note that this process may take a few minutes before the site goes live.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

To fork the repository:

Log in (or sign up) to Github.
Go to the repository for this project, ljtalks/journaling-app
Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

#### How to Clone

To clone the repository:

Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.
Go to the repository for this project, ljtalks/journaling-app
Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

[Here is my learning repository where I have attempted various YouTube tutorials whilst learning JavaScript, each project is credited with the source](https://ljtalks.github.io/my-first-js/)

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
