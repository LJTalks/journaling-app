# Inspire Me Journal

![Am I Responsive image](assets/images/readme-img/amiresponsive1.png)

# Overview
This project is a web-based journaling app designed to help users enhance productivity, focus, and mental clarity. Journaling is widely recongnised as a powerful tool to channel thoughts, set goals, and maintain a positive mindset. This app was created to facilitate that process by providing a structured space for daily reflection and idea generation.

This journaling app serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to improve their productivity and mental clarity. It‚Äôs a reflection of both my personal experiences and my growing skills in web development. I‚Äôm excited to continue improving this project, making it a more powerful resource for daily reflection and inspiration.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

![logo with heart, lightbub and writing pen](assets/images/inspireme-logo.png)
I created a simple logo in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and converted it to a Favicon using [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

**Inspirational Quote** (Future Implementation): The first feature intended for the app was an uplifting or inspiring quote that would greet the user each day. This quote would set a positive tone, fostering gratitude and focus before diving into the journal entry. While I encountered challenges with integrating the API for this feature, it's a planned addition for future updates.

**Content Ideas Generator**: To spark creativity, the app includes a Content Ideas Generator. Users can input a keyword or topic, and the app generates a variety of thought-provoking prompts. This feature is particularly useful for overcoming writer‚Äôs block or for guiding the journaling process.

**Journal Entry Section**: The core of the app is the journal entry section, where users can write and save their thoughts. Each entry is saved with a timestamp, making it easy to track progress over time. The journal entries are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they remain accessible and editable even after closing the app.

**Entry Management**: Users can view, edit, and delete their saved journal entries directly from the main page. This functionality is designed to make the journaling process seamless and flexible.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

**API Integration for Inspirational Quotes**: Successfully implement the API to fetch daily inspirational quotes.

**Enhanced Entry Management**: Add sorting, filtering, and search capabilities for journal entries.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

(Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.)

## Learning Outcomes

This project, while simple in scope, allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 

I focused on creating a responsive and user-friendly interface, while also incorporating important features like local storage and dynamic content generation. 

The challenges I faced, particularly with the API integration for the quote feature, have given me insight into areas for further learning and development.

[Here is my learning repository where I have attempted various YouTube tutorials whilst learning JavaScript, each project is credited with the source](https://ljtalks.github.io/my-first-js/)

### Code Used

I had a lot of assistance from recent YouTube tutorials I have tried. Many of these projects can be found here 

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
